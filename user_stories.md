## User stories
As a part of the marketing research team, I need a tool to accurately collect and chart feedback from potential customers in order to decide which products are most likely to sell.

As a developer, I want to make an adaptable program to randomly generate images and react to user clicks because this we want to easily measure customer input and account for adding new items to the store catalogue.

As s developer, I want to display results in chart so reasearchers can gauge the popularty of products

As a user to the site, I want a visually appealing interface that doesn't have too much clutter  and have smooth transitions and easy to navigate
